## Process

This section details my process. I have it here as I am still learning, and therefore I believe it's important to show my work so that if something goes amiss or a decision is one that raises questions, my reasoning can be found here. 

### Commit 1: Initial Commit
Created repository on GitHub

### Commit 2: NPM init
Package.json created

### Commit 3: Server and Packages
Created server file and installed needed packages. Required express in server file. 

### Commit 4: Create Schema
Schema is created. Next will be the seed file.

### Commit 5: Seed File
Seed file has been created. 

### Commit 6: Connection
Fixed seed file. Created a connection to the database.

### Commit 7: ORM
Added and connected the ORM file. 

### Commit 8: Burger.js
Made the model file Burger.js.

### Commit 9: controller
Wrote the controller file. 

### Commit 10: The rest of the base files
Added the rest of the base files before I move on to the handlebars. Going to sketch out how I want the site to look. 

### Commit 11: HTML Template
Created a template to base handlebars off of.

### Commit 12: Main Handlebars.
Added Main Handlebars.

### Commit 13: Rest of Handlebars
Rest of the handlebars have been added. 

### Commit 14: Javascript for page
js for page started

### Commit 15: npm start
Having trouble with Heroku. Changed program to run by npm start instead.

### Commit 16: Pull in password
pass was not being pulled in, so I just put it in. I made up this password for only mysql and will be changing it after the course ends, so it should be fine.

### Commit 17: Port Change
Google tells me it's likely that I still have my port as local host. I have now changed this. 

### Commit 18: JAWSDB
Now trying to set up JAWSDB

### Commit 19: Connect
Forgot to actually connect to the database

### Commit 20: Connection no longer const
Rather than redefine connection, I was telling the code there was a new const "connection". This has been fixed. 

### Commit 21: Missing .js 
Orm was not importing the file due to missing .js in the path

### Commit 22: undo npm start
Now it's telling me it's trying to run via node server.js so...

### Commit 23: Change port
Seeing if changing port on server will help

### Commit 24: HeidiSQL
Trying to set this up because google said it would help.

### Commit 25: Take 2 with SQL
Tried to add the table and seed data to this new database. 

### Commit 26: link to assets
fixed links to assets
